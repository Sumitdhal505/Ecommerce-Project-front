# Ecommerce-Project-front

In this project i have used React js, Tailwind css,Bootstrap etc to develop the project.
As this is a frontend project so to run this:-
 In terminal write command - npm start
It will open the project in development mode.
Make sure you are connected to Internet as it is required to call the API.

I have attached only the public and src folder .Node modules and other files/folders can be installed using npx create-react-app app
